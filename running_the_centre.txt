*** Zen Centre Opening / Closing Instructions ***


*** Opening ***

- The centre should be opened by about 5.30 (assuming 6.30 start) and certainly by about 5.45.

- The keypad for access to the Zen Centre once the two mortice locks are open can be retreived from Karl or a board member.

- Ideally there should be two people signed up for each evening – both as a backup and also just to help out as need be (obviously Karl will also be there quite often)

- Check whether the heating needs to go on (in winter the place might need 40 minutes or so to warm up)

- Someone should be downstairs by around 6.00 ready to open the door for anyone


*** Closing ***

- Remind people to pull the main door closed behind them when they go out onto Mitchell St

- Make sure all cups/plates have been washed and dried; you don’t have to do it yourself but need to make sure someone does.

- Turn the heating off before you leave.

- Check that all lights out



*** New People ***

- If there are new people coming along you should make them aware of the fire exits/procedure

- Generally make new people feel welcome, offer them opportunity to make a cup of tea/coffee etc. Introduce anyone new to one or two people
