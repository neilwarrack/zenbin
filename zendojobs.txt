***Zendo Jobs***

- Light incense around 6.25

- Around 6.25 people should start quietening down and be in the zendo getting ready for sitting to start

- Turn off your phone

- Check that the person playing the han is ready to play it before sitting starts

- Check lighting depending on the time of year and adjust accordingly

- If there’s dokusan, make sure you’re clear and confident about how to manage people coming to dokusan

- Put water in dokusan room if there’s dokusan

- Remind people to return all extra cushions to the cushion storage area and straighten out mats/cushions

- The person running the sitting is then responsible for checking that the zendo is left neat and tidy. If there has been dokusan, that person should also straighten out mats/cushions in the dokusan room and at teacher’s place in the zendo. They should also wash, dry and replace the water jug and cup from the dokusan room.

- General rules for running the zendo: if people are fidgeting (pretty rare) take them to one side during kinhin and remind them to try and sit still; no hats, shawls or bottles of water etc. in the zendo; once we have our screens to divide off the zendo, it should be kept in silence.
